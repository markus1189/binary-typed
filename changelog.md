`binary-typed` changelog
========================

## 0.1

### 0.1.0.0

Initial release.


### 0.1.0.1

- Add testsuite to compare generated message lengths with vanilla `Binary` and
  the various different typed serializations.
- The .cabal file is hopefully fixed so that Hackage is able to build the docs
  automatically.
